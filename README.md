# Major League Baseball Analysis by Parker Geis
This repository houses the files for various projects I have created.

# ERA Predictor
This project dives into the advanced metrics for all MLB pitchers (50 inning minimum) and identifies key factors in predicting ERA. Within this file users can see the data set and regression model creation.

The data is visualized in Tableau and can be found in my Tableau profile as ERA Analysis: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/parker.geis/vizzes
